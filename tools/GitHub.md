## Using GitHub

### Connect to GitHub via SSH
NOTE: GitHub advice is to use ONLY the SSH Agent provided with macOS.

Generate SSH Keys
- generate keys
```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "carolclark@cebcar"
```
- save at ~/.ssh/id_ed25519; supply passphrase

- verify connection via SSH Agent
```shell
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)
```

Authenticate with GitHub via SSH
- create file ~/.ssh/config
  - copy content from GitHub SSH
  - currently:<br>
```plaintext
    Host *
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      UseKeychain yes
      IdentityFile: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
- add GitHub SSH private key to SSH Agent
```
ssh --add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
- copy key to pasteboard
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
- add SSH private key to GitHub

  - Settings : Developer : SSH &amp; GPG Keys : New SSH Key; paste in key<br><br>

- verify connection
  - check count of existing known_hosts, if any<br><br>
  ```
  ssh -T git@github.com
  ```
  - continue if displayed key matches<br><br>
- verify: additional known_host at ~/.ssh

### Create New Repository
GitHub : ‘cebcar’ : New Repository
- supply repo Name and Description
- make repository “Public”
- add license, normally MIT <br><br>

## Repo Settings
*Settings Icon at right of project's menu bar*

### Features
  [-] Wikis; *expect editing from within wiki; not version controlled*
  [+] Issues
  [-] Sponsorships
  [-] Preserve this repository; *intended for long-term preservation of shared open-source code*
  [o] Discussions; *depending on whether there are collaborators*
  [+] Projects

### Pull Requests
#### Context:
According to [W3Docs: How to rebase a git branch](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/git/how-to-rebase-git-branch.html)
> Merging preserves history whereas rebasing rewrites it.

We want to see the branch organization in the commit history.

#### Merge:
  [+] Allow merge commits
  [-] Allow squash merging
  [-] Allow rebase merging (by definition, forces a single line of development with no branch organization)

  [+] Always suggest updating pull request branches
  [+] Automatically delete head branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*branches can still be restored* 

## > Branches

## Attach Local Repo
